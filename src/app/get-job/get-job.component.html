<h1>Level Four</h1>
<h4>You got the job! But you come down with a cold. In orientation, you carry a box of Kleenex with you everywhere. Your new coworkers shun you because of your sneezing and coughing. You work hard to impress the boss but the delirium of your cold-induced state results in bountiful typos throughout your code.</h4>
<h4>You wake up the next morning and find you can't get out of bed. You call in sick and end up talking to Peggy, the receptionist who gave you the weird eye on day one.</h4>
